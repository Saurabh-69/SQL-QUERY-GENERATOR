# SQL-QUERY-GENERATOR
This project is a Streamlit app that converts natural language questions into SQL queries using Google’s Gemini AI model and executes them on a PostgreSQL database. Users can input questions, view the generated SQL query, and see the query results—all in one interactive interface.
