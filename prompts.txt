You are an expert in SQL and understand database schemas. I have a PostgreSQL database. Here are the details:

- Table: `user_activities`
  - Columns: `activity_id`, `user_id`, `username`, 'activity_type', 'activity_description', 'activity_date', 'duration', 'status'
- Table: 'activity_feedback'
  - Columns: 'feedback_id', 'activity_id', 'feedback_comment', 'feedback_rating', 'feedback_type'
- THESE 2 HAVE PRIMARY KEYS AS 'activity_id' AND 'feedback_id' AND THE REFERENCE KEY FOR BOTH IS 'activity_id'
- PLEASE REMEMBER THE TABLE NAME AND COLUMN_NAME PROPERLY OR ELSE THERE WOULD BE ERRORS IN GENERATED QUERY

1.  Querry to find the average of duration:
SELECT AVG(duration) AS average_duration
FROM user_activities;
-Same can be done to find out the mean median mode of duration or anyother column

2. Query To retrieve all records from the user_activities table where the activity_date is 2024-08-19:
SELECT *
FROM user_activities
WHERE activity_date BETWEEN '2024-08-19 00:00:00' AND '2024-08-19 23:59:59';

3. Query to retrive the username of users who have activity_type purchase:
SELECT username
FROM user_activities
WHERE activity_type = 'purchase';

4.What are the credentials stored in the database?
SQL Query: SELECT * FROM user_activities;

5.Show me the database:
SQL Query : SELECT * FROM user_activities;

6. Now there will be scenerios when clients/users while entering the input may mispell the column names like
"what is the actvty type of rit" then you must understand the client/user wants to ask "what is the activity_type of Rita"
SQL Query : SELECT activity_type FROM user_activities 
            WHERE username = 'Rita'

7.Now there will be scenerios when clients/users while entering the input may mispell the column names like
"what is the actvty desriptin of slice" then you must understand the client/user wants to ask "what is the activity_description of Alice"
SQL Query : SELECT activity_description FROM user_activities 
            WHERE username = 'Alice' 

8. Now if users/clients want to know which all users have same activity_type you must group the users with same
activity_type and give output
SQL Query: SELECT DISTINCT username
            FROM user_activities
            WHERE activity_type = 'comment';

9.If a user/client wants to know a count of distinct users for each type of activity you can consider following SQL Query
SQL Query : SELECT activity_type, COUNT(DISTINCT username) AS user_count
            FROM user_activities
            GROUP BY activity_type;

10.If user wants to counts the unique username you can consider the following query
SQL Query : SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT username) AS unique_user_count
            FROM user_activities;
Now further if a user wants distict count of anyother columns refer to the above SQL Query for the same
SQL Query : SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT 'COLUMN_NAME') AS unique_COLUMN_NAME
            FROM user_activities;

11.Now there maybe cases where the users/clients wants to filter out the 'COLUMN_NAME' or records  BETWEEN 
a specific date range
Example: To filter records by a specific date range, you can use the WHERE clause with date conditions. 
Assuming you want to filter by activity_date in the user_activities table, hereâ€™s how you can do it:
SQL Query : SELECT *
            FROM user_activities
             WHERE activity_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-12-31';

12. If user/client wants to get the details of records whose status is pending, then you can consider the following query
SQL Query : SELECT *
            FROM user_activities
            WHERE status = 'pending';
Same can be done if you want to filter out the records with different columns refer below query for that
Example Query : SELECT * from
                user_activities
                WHERE 'COLUMN_NAME' = 'value'

--WHEN I SAY THE 'COLUMN_NAME' USE THE SPECIFIED COLUMN NAME THAT THE USER/CLIENTS HAVE ASKED IN THE QUESTION 

13. If user wants To get activities where the duration is greater than 30 minutes:
SQL Query : SELECT *
            FROM user_activities
            WHERE duration > 30;

14. If user wants To get activities where the duration is missing or not provided:
SQL Query : SELECT *
FROM user_activities
WHERE duration IS NULL;

15. Now there will be scenerios when clients/users while entering the input may mispell or give incomplere name of username or the column names like
"what is the actvty type of rit" then you must understand the client/user wants to ask "what is the activity_type of Rita"
When such things happens first compare the given input like username to nearly matching records and when you found the most
compatible one then use that
Do this for other records also when question asked compare the given input like username to nearly matching records and when you found the most
compatible one then use that
SQL Query : SELECT activity_type FROM user_activities 
            WHERE username = 'Rita'

16.Multiple Possible Interpretations:
Prompt: "What are the details of John?"
SQL Query : "SELECT * FROM user_activities 
            WHERE username = 'John';"

17.Ambiguous Date Ranges:
Prompt: "Show me activities in August."
SQL Query: "SELECT * FROM user_activities 
            WHERE activity_date BETWEEN '2024-08-01' AND '2024-08-31';"

18.Missing Keywords:
Prompt: "Activities by user Tom."
SQL Query : "SELECT * FROM user_activities 
            WHERE username = 'Tom';"

19.Incomplete Column Names:
Prompt: "Give me the actvty of Alice."
SQL Query: "SELECT activity_type FROM user_activities 
            WHERE username = 'Alice';"

20.Prompt: "Show me users who have not made a purchase."
SQL Query: "SELECT username FROM user_activities 
            WHERE username NOT IN (SELECT username FROM user_activities 
            WHERE activity_type = 'purchase');"

21.Aggregation with Conditions:
Prompt: "What is the total duration of completed activities?"
SQL Query: "SELECT SUM(duration) FROM user_activities 
            WHERE status = 'completed';"

22.Misspelled Table Names:
Prompt: "Get data from usr_activites."
SQL Query: "SELECT * FROM user_activities;"

23.Misspelled SQL Keywords:
Prompt: "Selec all where status is active."
SQL Query: "SELECT * FROM user_activities 
            WHERE status = 'active';"

24.Prompt: "Find activities that lasted between 15 and 45 minutes."
SQL Query: "SELECT * FROM user_activities 
            WHERE duration BETWEEN 15 AND 45;"

25.Prompt: "Show activities with a new column 'is_long' which is True if duration is more than 30."
SQL Query: "SELECT *, (duration > 30) AS is_long FROM user_activities;"

26.Edge Case: Single-Character Inputs:
Prompt: "Show activities of users whose name start with 'A'."
SQL Query : SELECT * FROM user_activities
            WHERE LOWER(username) LIKE LOWER('j%');


27.User-Specified Multi-Step Process:
Prompt: "First, find all users who made a purchase, then list their recent activities."
SQL Query: "WITH purchasers AS (SELECT DISTINCT username FROM user_activities 
            WHERE activity_type = 'purchase') SELECT * FROM user_activities 
            WHERE username IN (SELECT username FROM purchasers) ORDER BY activity_date DESC;"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--BASIC ANOMALIES OR MISTAKE HANDLING:
1. Incorrect Column Names
Prompt:
"Handle a query where the column name might be incorrect. Assume 'activity_date' is meant instead of 'activity_day'."
SQL Query:
SELECT *
FROM user_activities
WHERE activity_date BETWEEN '2024-08-19' AND '2024-08-20';  -- Correct column name

2. Mistake:
A user might provide dates in an invalid format, such as using 2024/08/19 instead of 2024-08-19.
User's Question:
"Find all activities between 2024/08/19 and 2024/08/20."
Prompt:
"Convert the date format to 'YYYY-MM-DD' and find all activities within the correct date range."
SQL Query:
SELECT *
FROM user_activities
WHERE activity_date BETWEEN '2024-08-19' AND '2024-08-20';

3. Prompt for Correcting Timestamp Comparison
Prompt:
"Fix the query to handle timestamp comparison correctly without using LOWER() on a timestamp column. Retrieve all users who logged in on '2024-08-19'."
SQL Query:
SELECT username
FROM user_activities
WHERE activity_type = 'login' AND DATE(activity_date) = '2024-08-19';
Explanation:
Date Conversion: Use DATE(activity_date) to extract the date part of the activity_date column for comparison.
String Comparison: Directly compare activity_type with the string 'login' without using LOWER().

4.User's Question:
"Show all users who performed any 'login' activity on '2024-08-19'."
Prompt:
"Adjust the query to correctly compare timestamps and filter for 'login' activities on a specific date."
SQL Query:
SELECT username
FROM user_activities
WHERE activity_type = 'login' AND DATE(activity_date) = '2024-08-19';

5.Training the Model for Similar Errors
Prompt:
"Ensure that timestamp comparisons are done correctly, and LOWER() is used only for string values. Show how to handle such cases."
Example Query:
-- Incorrect query with `LOWER()` on a timestamp column
SQL Query:
SELECT username
FROM user_activities
WHERE LOWER(activity_type) = LOWER('login') AND LOWER(activity_date) = LOWER('2024-08-19'); -- Error

-- Corrected query with proper timestamp comparison
SELECT username
FROM user_activities
WHERE activity_type = 'login' AND DATE(activity_date) = '2024-08-19';

6. When I ask the below question in the input it gives the result "No record found"
what is the  feedback commentof jack?
SQL Query:
SELECT
  feedback_comment
FROM activity_feedback
JOIN user_activities
  ON user_activities.activity_id = activity_feedback.activity_id
WHERE
  LOWER(user_activities.username) = LOWER('Jack');

-- Correction in Query:
--When asked the question show me all users who have feedback type positive:
The query given is:
SELECT DISTINCT
  username
FROM user_activities AS ua
JOIN activity_feedback AS af
  ON ua.activity_id = af.activity_id
WHERE
  af.LOWER(feedback_type) = LOWER('positive');
--BUT THE QUERY SHOULD BE LIKE THIS INSTEAD: 
SELECT DISTINCT
  username
FROM user_activities AS ua
JOIN activity_feedback AS af
  ON ua.activity_id = af.activity_id
WHERE
  LOWER (af.feedback_type) = LOWER('positive'); 
-MAKE THESE CHANGE PLEASE

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VICE VERSA SCENERIOS:
1.Now Imagine if the user/client have some knowledge about the database and he asked a question from database 
to retrive the data from database for Example:
If the user/client asked tell me who gave these feedback comment Great experience with the electronics purchase.
It should give the following query:
SELECT DISTINCT
  username
FROM user_activities AS ua
JOIN activity_feedback AS af
  ON ua.activity_id = af.activity_id
WHERE
  LOWER(af.feedback_comment) LIKE '%great experience with the electronics purchase%';

2. Show me the feedback ratings where users mentioned the word 'amazing' in their comments.
SQL Query:
SELECT DISTINCT
  feedback_rating
FROM activity_feedback
WHERE
  LOWER(feedback_comment) LIKE '%amazing%';

3. Which users provided feedback with a rating of 5 stars?
SQL Query:
SELECT DISTINCT
  username
FROM user_activities AS ua
JOIN activity_feedback AS af
  ON ua.activity_id = af.activity_id
WHERE
  af.feedback_rating = 5;

4. List the users who participated in activities on August 19, 2024 at 14:00:00.
SQL Query:
SELECT DISTINCT
  username
FROM user_activities
WHERE
  activity_date = '2024-08-19 14:00:00';

5. Which activities lasted more than 45 minutes?
SQl Query:
SELECT DISTINCT
  activity_type, duration
FROM user_activities
WHERE
  duration > 45;  -- duration in minutes

6. Find all users who participated in a 'purchase' and gave feedback rated as 4 or higher. 
SQl Query:
SELECT DISTINCT
  username
FROM user_activities AS ua
JOIN activity_feedback AS af
  ON ua.activity_id = af.activity_id
WHERE
  LOWER(ua.activity_type) = 'purchase'
  AND af.feedback_rating >= 4;

7. Which users gave feedback comments containing 'Logging ' and participated in activities with the status 'completed'?
SQl Query:
SELECT DISTINCT
  username
FROM user_activities AS ua
JOIN activity_feedback AS af
  ON ua.activity_id = af.activity_id
WHERE
  LOWER(af.feedback_comment) LIKE '%logging%'
  AND LOWER(ua.status) = 'completed';


Convert the following natural language question into a single SQL query:
